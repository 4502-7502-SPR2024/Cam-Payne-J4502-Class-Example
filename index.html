				<p>Mizzou Softball finished last year with a 35-26 record but extended the program's streak of regional appearances to 16 straight. The Tigers return five pitchers in the circle and add two with its freshmen class. "The infield looks to be a strength for Mizzou this year with returning players Jenna Laird, Maddie Gallagher, Kara Daly, and Katie Chester, along with the addition of talented freshmen Madison Walker, Adi Koller, and Abby Hay. With returner Julia Crenshaw, along with freshmen additions Stefania Abruscato and Abby Hay, the Tigers are expected to be a force behind the plate.The talent is just as deep in the outfield with returners Alex Honnold, Chantice Philips, Kayley Lenger, plus transfer standout Mya Dodge, and freshmen additions Claire Cahalan and Danielle Blackstun. With talent all over the field, the Tigers look to be a force in the SEC this year.</p>
