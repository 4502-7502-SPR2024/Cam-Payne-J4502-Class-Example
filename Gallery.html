        <h1>Homecoming at the ZOU</h1>
          <p>Homecoming at the University of Missouri is a tradition like no other. Mizzou was the first school to have a "homecoming", when Coach Chester Brewer invited almuni to "come home" for a football game against hated rival kU in 1911. This tradition has carried on for over on hundred year, but looks very different today.</p>
          <p>Today, Mizzou's Homecoming is a week longg tradition as buisness downtown are painted, a 5k is hosted, talents shows in Greek town, a homecoming court, and much more. But the week of celebration though is concluded on a college football Saturday, with a parade through campus and dowtown Columbia in the morning and capped off by Mizzou's home football game later in the day.</p>
