      <h1>Top Seven SEC Stadiums</h1>
      <p>The Southeastern conference is more than what takes place on the dimond. It wouldn't be a true site about all things for this conference if was not in the fold. Even in the offseason football is king in the SEC becuase "It just means more". So with that being said we have made a list of the top seven SEC football stadiums. </p>

          <p>How about a cheer for ole Mizzou. Farout Field comes in at number one on this list. It may not be the biggest venue but when the Missouri Tigers are rolling the fans pack the hill and the enviroment is electric. When Tiger fans show out it becomes a diffcult place for opposing offesnes to operate as the sound can get defining, espcially when Mr. Brightside plays. An underated site witha frenzied fanbase.</p>

          <p>When the sun goes down and the lights turn on at Tiger stadium its where dreams go to die. Better known as Death Valley, this stadium's atmosphere is best in primetime games. The fans get more frienzed and the Bayou Bengal Tigers get more amped as the opposing team looks to march into the valley of death. </p>

          <p>Where cheers for "War Eagle" can be heard. On the plains in Auburn, Alabama this place is known for voodoo magic. It doesn;t matter the record the Auburn Tigers have if they at home best believe a team will be on its heels. There is always an external force at Jordan Hare that makes it that much more diffuclt for the enemy of the Auburn Tigers.</p>
